<summary>Abstract</summary>
I study the recovery of the Roman economy following the papacy’s sojourn in France (1309-1377). I show that a reform of inheritance laws in 1480 gave rise to an era of palace-building resulting in the construction of over 35% of palaces built in Roman history. Using a novel dataset that links information on investment projects and patrons, I provide evidence that the reform, which allowed prelates to bequeath their possessions, caused a significant increase of prelate palace-building relative to their lay counterparts (who were not directly affected by the reform). Initial prelate investment then guaranteed that the papacy would remain in Rome long-term, which eventually incentivized laymen to invest – though the return of the papacy to Rome itself had failed to induce investment. Increased confidence in Rome's future also manifested in more ambitious projects, across all patrons. I disentangle the effect of commitment to long-term presence from the effects of contemporaneous papal presence in Rome to show that the irreversibility of institutional change is a necessary condition for successful intervention.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
A social planner considers the far future, asking which population profile should be preferred, where none of the people involved has been born or conceived yet. A population’s profile is given by the number of individuals who are in each possible position. Thus, symmetry among individuals who are in the same position is presupposed by the model. The model allows populations to be of different sizes, and assumes that they can be compared by the social planner. Three simple conditions characterize the relations that can be represented in a utilitarian way, that is, by assigning a number to each position so that profiles are ranked according to the sum of utilities across individuals.
