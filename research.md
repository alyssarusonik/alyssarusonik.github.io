	I study the recovery of the Roman economy following the papacy’s absence (1309-1377), specifically, an era of palace-building resulting in the construction of over 31% of palaces built in Roman history. Using a novel dataset, I show that the late-15th-century palace-construction boom was triggered by credible institutional commitment. A reform of inheritance laws (1475) allowed prelates to bequeath their possessions, causing a significant increase of prelate palace-building. Initial prelate investment guaranteed the papacy would remain in Rome long-term, which eventually incentivized laymen to invest. I disentangle the effect of commitment to long-term presence from contemporaneous papal presence to show that the irreversibility of institutional change is a necessary condition for successful intervention.</small>

<small>
The paper makes three contributions to the preference aggregation and population ethics literatures. First, we propose the "lexitarian" criterion, according to which the social planner maximizes a vector of lexicographically-ranked utilitarian functions. Second, we suggest modeling the social choice problem using “positions” as a primitive, and axiomatize the lexitarian rule in this context. Third, we argue for an interpretation of the model in terms of the impersonal approach, while prioritizing needs over wants.
